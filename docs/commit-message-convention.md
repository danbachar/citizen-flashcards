The commit message should be structured as follows:

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.

Examples
Commit message with description and breaking change footer
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
Commit message with scope and ! to draw attention to breaking change
feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
Commit message with both ! and BREAKING CHANGE footer
feat!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.

feat(lang): add Polish language
Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.
